/*
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 */

Approach --> Sort the array and traverse from last idex to first index, use a temporary variable starting from 1 and if the element at current index is greater than or equal to the current temp variable, increase temp by one for next iteration.
The first condition which fails will give the current temp var reduse one from it and return that will be the H index
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);  //Sort the Array as the current index can be modified
        int len=nums.length;
        int res=1;    // Temporary variable which will be increased 
        for(int i= len-1;i>=0;i--){
            if(nums[i]>=res)
             res++;
             else break;
        }
        return res-1;
    }
}
